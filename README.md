# patient-management-system
My IBDP Computer Science Project - a patient management system for a clinic, developed using Java and mysql
Allows patients to book appointments, reschedule them, and view details regarding previous consultations.
Allows the management team to view details regarding current and past appointments and lets the doctor add a prescription and general comments for each patient apointment.
